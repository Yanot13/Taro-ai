iOS Taro application
Privacy Policy — Taro AI

Effective date: 30 Oct 2025

“Taro AI” (“we”, “our”, “the App”) provides tarot card readings and AI-generated interpretations. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

1) Who we are

Controller: Taro AI

App Bundle ID: ai.taro.app

2) What data we collect

No account by default: the App can be used without registration.

User input: optional question text for a reading and your deck/spread choices.

AI processing data: the above input plus drawn card names are sent to our AI provider to generate interpretations.

Local settings: sound, candles/effects, language, “majors-only” mode, etc. (stored locally on your device).

Optional sign-in (for subscriptions): email address if you choose “Sign in with Apple” or email magic link.

Payments: In-App Purchases are processed by Apple. We do not receive or store your card data.

Diagnostics/analytics: standard Apple App Analytics and crash logs; no third-party tracking SDKs unless explicitly enabled in future updates.

3) Legal bases & purposes

We process data to (i) provide readings and app functionality, (ii) handle purchases/subscriptions and restore access, (iii) secure and improve the App, (iv) comply with law. Legal bases under GDPR: performance of a contract, legitimate interests, and consent (where required).

4) Sharing & processors

We do not sell personal data. We use service providers strictly for the App’s operation:

OpenAI (AI text generation): receives your question text and drawn card names to create an interpretation.

Apple (IAP, analytics, Sign in with Apple).

Supabase (auth & subscription records; email magic links).
All providers act as processors under their terms and apply industry-standard security.

5) Data retention

Question texts used for readings are not tied to your identity and are not stored on our servers; they may be cached transiently to deliver the response.

Subscription records and auth emails (if you sign in) are stored in Supabase for as long as your subscription/account is active and as required by law.

Device-local settings remain on your device until you delete the App.

TestFlight feedback & crashes are handled by Apple per its policies.

6) Your choices & rights

Use the App without registration.

Opt in/out of email sign-in.

Access, correct, or delete your data (where applicable). Requests: [Telegram_bot](https://t.me/helptaroai_bot)
.

In iOS settings you can reset advertising identifiers and limit analytics.

7) Children

The App is not intended for children under 13 (or under the age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect children’s data.

8) Security

We use TLS encryption in transit and reputable cloud infrastructure (Apple, Supabase, OpenAI). No method is 100% secure, but we take reasonable measures to protect your data.

9) International transfers

Our processors may operate globally. Where required, appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs) are applied by the processors.

10) Changes

We may update this Policy; the effective date will be revised. Continued use of the App means you accept the updated Policy.
